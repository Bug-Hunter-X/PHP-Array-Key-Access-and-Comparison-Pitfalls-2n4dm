This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP related to array key access and comparison.  The `bug.php` file illustrates the problem, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

The core issue is PHP's flexibility with array keys, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.  The example highlights how attempting to access a non-existent key results in a notice (or error depending on the context), and how loose comparison (`==`) of numeric strings and integers can cause unexpected equality.

This repository aims to raise awareness of these subtle yet potentially problematic aspects of PHP array handling and offers a straightforward solution.
